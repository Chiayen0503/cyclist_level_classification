We first process labellers' csv and calculate certainty score for each image. Then, we collect those which has certainty score>0.5. Finally we re-train a pre-trained VGG model on our binary-class dataset. To deal with imbalance data, we apply (1) resampling (2) augmentation on train set only. Then, we save a model with the best macro-f1 score.
